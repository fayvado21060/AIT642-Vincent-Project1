Lessons learn from the installation of Eclipse, Eclipse EGit, and Javadoc
Installing Eclipse was not a difficult task. I forgot that I did not have Java 
installed on my computer and had to install that before I could get Eclipse to open up.  
After installing Java, I did have some problems opening Eclipse and I think it was because
of where it wanted to place the workspace.  Once I had it install I tried out several “Hello World” programs.
I read the documentation which step me through creating simple programs to run and illustrated 
the different features of Eclipse.  I installed EGit desktop but was not sure how to get it
 to work with the online repository.   I will continue with the process hoping to gain a better 
 understanding of EGit as I step through the different tasks.  
 
 Javadoc was also easy to install and just as easy to understand how to use by right clicking on item 
 to document.  Not sure of all of the features but I have the basic function down.
